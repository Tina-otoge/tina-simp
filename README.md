This is my personal website, written using my own Jekyll alternative https://github.com/Tina-otoge/sssimp

It serves as my playground to decide on new features to implement in sssimp and test it in a real-life scenario.

Thanks to sssimp, it uses Jinja templating, bundled files, markdown conversion with plugins, and a dozens of
available metadata on pages to use in templates.

It also uses https://brython.info/ for browser-side scripting, the Python implementation for the browser.
