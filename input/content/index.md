I am Damien Savatier, more known online as "Tina".  I like anime, programming,
Linux, rhythm games and the ðŸŒ¸ emoji.

# My internet presence

I've been active on forums and social media since around 2010. Nowadays chances
are you either know me from **Twitter** or **Discord** communities. I also
occasionally upload rhythm games scores to my [**YouTube channel**][youtube/me]
as a way to keep an archive of my progress, usually in the form of clips from
my live streams which are multi-cast to YouTube, Twitch and Twitter.

# Rhythm games

The hobby I dedicate myself the most to is unarguably rhythm games. I've fiddled
with DJ Hero, Band Hero and Patapon as a kid, but it's not until I've been
introduced to **osu! in 2014** that I started being serious about them. While on
my osu! journey, I've been exposed to arcade rhythm games through the extensive
library of stolen content the game has. For a while I was under the belief that
I would never be able to try these games without going to eastern Asia, until I
was proven wrong in **Autumn 2015** and visited the now defunct **Arcade
Street** in Paris which had a lot of major arcade rhythm games, such as
beatmania IIDX, pop'n music, Taiko no Tatsujin, jubeat, and inevitably
DanceDanceRevolution.

Today I own several arcade controller replicas, namely but not exhaustively 3
**IIDX** controllers, 2 **pop'n music** controllers, 2 **Taiko** drums, an
**SDVX** controller, a metal **DDR** dance pad, a **Groove Coaster** controller,
a 24-inch **touchscreen**, and my passion even spread to my relatives as my
girlfriend owns an actual **jubeat arcade cabinet**.

I'm very passionate about them and I try to play a bit of every rhythm game out
there. I spend most of my time and efforts getting better at IIDX and SDVX, but
when I get the chance I also play other, including smaller and less known games.
Have you tried Rhythm Doctor or Just Shape & Beats? They are amazing!

I am also known for being the founder of [**Make Some Noise**][msn], a French
organization and community for rhythm games enthusiasts. Our main goals are to
create a way for the French players to interact together and to share our
passion and knowledge about the games with others. This takes the form of
organizing events, both IRL and online, having a presence at conventions such
as the Japan Expo or Epitanime, and an active online [**Discord
community**][msn/discord].

# Tech, computers, programming and school

I am a developer. I'm currently enrolled at the French graduate school
[EPITECH][wikipedia/epitech] which delivers the equivalent of a master's degree
in computer science, with a strong emphasis on doing almost exclusively
practical projects and no theoretical courses. I also did 1 year of prep school
at [EPITA][wikipedia/epita] but was unmotivated by the science courses and was
redirected to EPITECH by the teachers.

I've been interested into programming and making personal projects **since
2011**, when I was still only 12 years old. I started with Lua scripting through
the Minecraft mod ComputerCraft and moved to learning HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP
and (My)SQL quickly after. Later in 2018 I was charmed by **Python** and been
using it extensively in both personal projects and professional jobs.  This
website uses Python instead of JavaScript for browser-side scripting thanks to
some black magic.

I open source almost all of my projects so you can probably learn more about my
tastes in languages and libraries by browsing my [**GitHub**][github/me].

# Linux and the open source spirit

I use **Linux as my daily driver**. At some point I was also using it for my
main gaming activities (excluding arcade rhythm games), but either since I
upgraded my main machine to an SSD, rebooting to Windows was so fast that I just
keep a minimal Windows install to play games, which is less effort than fiddling
with compatibility tools, even though running Windows games on Linux is way
easier nowadays thanks to Valve's efforts. I still play on Linux for some games
including but not exclusively Minecraft.

I tried different distributions but the one that I love the most is [**Fedora
Linux**][wikipedia/fedora]. I resonate a lot with it, and I am a big fan of the
projects it adopts or pushes forward, such as Flatpak, Wayland, GNOME, Podman,
PipeWire, and many others. It is often the first major distro to embrace new
Linux desktop technologies, and it gets very frequent updates, even in the
non-rolling release branch. I also use [**Rocky Linux**][wikipedia/rocky] on my
servers, which is a community version of [Red Hat Enterprise
Linux][wikipedia/rhel], the main sponsor of the Fedora Project, and which uses
Fedora as its upstream.

I'm really a fan of the philosophy behind free and open source softwares, and
I'm astonished every day by the sheer amount of choices, alternatives,
customizations, interoperability and freedom it offers. I'm frustrated every
time I'm using Windows because it's hard to bend the OS to make it resembles my
perfect dream workflow, meanwhile the nature of Linux and the way free softwares
are developed makes it very easy to tweak every part of my OS to fits my
fantasies.

Open source also means anyone can learn and become a better developer by reading
the source code of high quality projects. Motivated and talented developers can
contribute to existing projects. In case of developers disappearing or losing
interest, others can take the lead. Anyone can meaningfully help by reporting
bugs or requesting features. And contrary to popular belief, open source
software can generate revenue, either through commercializing the product, or
through sponsorships and donations. I really like open source and think it's
beneficial to any kind of software project, my ideal job would be to be paid to
write open source software.

# Other hobbies

Rhythm games are not my only hobby, I am a lot into **anime** and **Japanese
culture** in general. [I pick up][mal/me] new series every **season** at the
same time their air on Japanese TV. I watch anime for the stories but also for
the animation and art.  I am understandably also a lot into anime-style
**drawings** in general, I follow a lot of independent and professional
artists, and wish I could spend more money on commissions and goods.

I am also not ashamed to say I consume a good fair of adult content, mainly
drawings, manga and games, both amateur and professional. There is a plethora
of absolute gems hidden behind the "it also happens to be porn" barrier out
there and I'm very happy I went past it. I'm a great fan of
[**AliceSoft**][vndb/alicesoft] and [**Illusion**][wikipedia/illusion] games
and I follow a unhealthy amount of hentai artists.

As you would expect from someone who enjoys rhythm games, I also consume a lot
of **music**, a fair amount of it is from the electronic independent eastern
Asian scene, as it is strongly tied to rhythm games. Please buy albums from the
artists you like on their bandcamp or equivalent platforms to support them.

As far as more mainstream games go, I play some Minecraft and CS:GO from time to
time but nowhere near as much as rhythm games, mainly when some friends ask me
to join them. I have some Rocket League and Smash phases, where I try to get
better at the games.
