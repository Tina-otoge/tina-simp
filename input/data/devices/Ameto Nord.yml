name: For some time it was called the PekoPhone because I had a very cool Pekora wallpaper. Ameto is the red haired girl from beatmania IIDX you may know from BGAs such as REDALiCE's Little Star.
date: 2021 - Present

usage: This is my current phone. It's a very big upgrade from my previous one which was a low specs Nokia. The powerful chip, 90Hz monitor, near vanilla OS, and large memory space makes it a painless Android experience. I almost never play games on my phone, but on the very rare occasions I do, I'm glad I don't have to worry about free space or performances. I only want OnePlus phones now.
