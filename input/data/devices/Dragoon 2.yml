product: Nintendo Switch (Unpatched original revision "HAC-001")

name: Dragoon is one of the vehicles from Kirby Air Ride, even though I haven't played the game, it's a cool item in the Smash Bros series. A vehicle is a fitting theme for the "mobility" of the Switch. The "2" in the name is because it's actually my 2nd Switch as I had to return the 1st one only two weeks after buying it due to what I'd describe as a severe screen burning issue.
date: August 2018 - Present

usage: Since a friend had the kindess to lend me his Switch he bought soonly after launch, I already played through Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Super Mario Odyssey, and Breath of the Wild. I was able to transfer my profile and saves to my Switch, but I didn't rebuy these games. I spent most of my playtime on Smash and VOEZ. I bought plenty of games on it, including several rhythm games. But in 2022 I finally decided to give in to the temptation of taking advantage of having an original unpatched Switch, meaning I could hack the system, install homebrew applications, and pirated games if I felt like it. This breathed a very needed new life into it as it was starting to slowly collect dust aside from when I have friends at home who want to play Smash. Ever since the entirety of the Switch library was made available to me for free, I mostly played games I already own on other platforms, but with the comfort of an handheld, such as Muse Dash, Celeste, or A Hat in Time. A very cool homebrew I use is SysDVR to stream the output of my Switch to my computer without using a capture card.
