name: It is the first time I didn't name one of my servers after animals species and went for a waifu instead. Laffey is the cute bunny girl loli which acts as one of the 3 starters in Azur Lane.

usage: My dedicated server hosts several services which are important to me, such as my websites, bots, file hosting, torrent clients and game servers. I also lend unpriviledged user access to it to friends for a very inexpensive monthly fee.
