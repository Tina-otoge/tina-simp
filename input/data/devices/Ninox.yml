name: At that time I was decided on naming my machines after animal species. A ninox is also called an Hack-owl. A nocturnal animal felt right for something called "nightblade", also it starts with "ni" just like "nightblade".
date: 20XX - Present

usage: This is my current main computer. I have a Windows and Linux dual boot setup on this machine. I mostly use it on Linux, and I use Windows if I want to play arcade rhythm games, or if I want to livestream, as performance on Windows with recording softwares seems way better, probably an NVIDIA thing.
