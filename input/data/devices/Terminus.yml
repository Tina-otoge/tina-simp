name: This one actually went through a lot of names, as I renamed it each time I was reinstalling my OS. The first name was "trex" (as-in t-rex), as I was still using animal species names for my devices. "T-Rex" is 4 letters and starts with a T, just like T470, the model name, if you do not include the "s". It now harbors the name of Est Terminus, a fictional sword, also the name of a main character in the light novel Serei Tsukai no Blade Dance, a white haired loli.

text: This is my main "work" machine. I got rid of Windows on it when I bought a new dedicated computer for running pop'n music since that was the only reason I still had Windows. The blazing fast CPU and RAM makes for an amazingly smooth programming environment. The fast charging, dual batteries, USB-C and SD card ports makes for a very complete and versatile work station. I love my ThinkPad.
